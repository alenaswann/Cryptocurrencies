# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
### This analysis covers unsupervised machine learning with the specific deliverables below applied to a dataset on cryptocurrencies. The goal was to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for Accountability Accounting's new investment portfolio option.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
  - Data was cleaned and prepared for machine learning models   
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
  - Data dimensions were reduced to 3 principal components by PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
  - An Elbow Curve was used to find the ideal number of clusters (K), which was used in the K-Means model to cluster the data
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results Using HVPlot and Plotly Express
  - The data clusters were visualized in both 2D and 3D scatter plots
